# Storything - A Story Index Generator

Storything is a simple website template that makes it easy for an author to
build an index of their stories.

To use, simply grab a release (which includes the bundled and minified javascript),
and update the stories.csv file to your needs. 

When someone loads a page, the javascript wil read the csv file, and render the
stories, and provide a simple and easy way for a reader to search using tags!
